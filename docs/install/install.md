Sveltos is a set of Kubernetes controllers deployed in the management cluster. From the management cluster, Sveltos can manage add-ons and applications in multiple clusters.

## Installation

To install Sveltos, run the following commands:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/manifest.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/default-classifier.yaml
```
[^2]

In this mode, Sveltos will deploy up to two agents, *sveltos-agent* and *drift-detection-manager*[^1], in each managed clusters.
If you don't want to have any Sveltos agent in any managed cluster, run the following commands:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/agents_in_mgmt_cluster_manifest.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/default-classifier.yaml
```

In this mode, Sveltos agents will be created, per managed cluster, in the management cluster itself.

Sveltos uses the git-flow branching model. The base branch is dev. If you are looking for latest features, please use the dev branch. If you are looking for a stable version, please use the main branch or tags labeled as v0.x.x.

## Install using helm

```
helm repo add projectsveltos https://projectsveltos.github.io/helm-charts

[^1]: sveltos-agent will be deployed if there is at least one Classifier instance in the management cluster. Drift detection manager will be deployed if there is a ClusterProfile instance with SyncMode set to *ContinuousWithDriftDetection*.
