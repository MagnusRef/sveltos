## Deploying addons

[ClusterProfile](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-manager/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/clusterprofile_types.go) is the CRD used to instructs Sveltos about:

1. which Kubernetes addons to deploy;
2. where (on which Kubernetes clusters) to deploy the addons. 

![ClusterProfile](assets/sveltos_different_policies.png)

### Cluster Selection
The *clusterSelector* field is a Kubernetes label selector. Sveltos uses it to detect all the clusters where addons need to be deployed.

Example: clusterSelector: env=prod

### Helm charts

The *helmCharts* field allows to list a set of helm charts to deploy. Sveltos will deploy helm chart in the same exact order those are defined in this field.

### Kubernetes resources

The *policyRefs* field points to list of ConfigMaps/Secrets. Each referenced ConfigMap/Secret contains yaml/json content as value. 

Both Secrets and ConfigMaps data fields can be a list of key-value pairs. Any key is acceptable, and as value, there can be multiple objects in yaml or json format.

Secrets are preferred if the data includes sensitive information.

The following YAML file is an example of ConfigMap, containing multiple resources. 
When Sveltos deploys this ConfigMap as part of our ClusterProfile, a GatewayClass and Gateway instance are automatically deployed in any matching cluster.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: contour-gateway
  namespace: default
data:
  gatewayclass.yaml: |
    kind: GatewayClass
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    metadata:
      name: contour
    spec:
      controllerName: projectcontour.io/projectcontour/contour
  gateway.yaml: |
    kind: Namespace
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: projectcontour
    ---
    kind: Gateway
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    metadata:
     name: contour
     namespace: projectcontour
    spec:
      gatewayClassName: contour
      listeners:
        - name: http
          protocol: HTTP
          port: 80
          allowedRoutes:
            namespaces:
              from: All

```

### Sync mode

The syncMode field has three possible options. Continuous and OneTime are explained below. DryRun is explained in a separate section.

Example: syncMode: Continuous

*OneTime*

Upon deployment of a ClusterProfile with a syncMode configuration of OneTime, all clusters are checked for a clusterSelector match, and all matching clusters will have the current ClusterProfile-specified features installed at that time.

Any subsequent changes to the ClusterProfile instance will not be deployed into the already matching clusters.

*Continuous*

When the syncMode configuration is Continuous, any new changes made to the ClusterProfile instanceare immediately reconciled into the matching clusters.

Reconciliation consists of one of these actions on matching clusters:

1. deploy a feature â€” whenever a feature is added to the ClusterProfile or when a cluster newly matches the ClusterProfile;
1. update a feature â€” whenever the ClusterProfile configuration changes or any referenced ConfigMap/Secret changes;
1. remove a feature â€” whenever a Helm release or a ConfigMap/Secret is deleted from the ClusterProfile.

*Continuous with configuration drift detection*

See [Configuration Drift](#configuration-drift).

*DryRun*

See [Dry Run Mode](#dryrun-mode).

### DryRun mode

Before adding, modifying, or deleting a ClusterProfile, it is often useful to see what changes will result from the action. When you deploy a ClusterProfile with a syncMode configuration of DryRun, a workflow is launched that will simulate all of the operations that would be executed in an actual run. No actual change is applied to matching clusters in the dry run workflow, so there are no side effects. 

The dry run workflow generates a list of potential changes for each matching cluster, allowing you to inspect and validate these changes before deploying the new ClusterProfile configuration.

You can see the change list by viewing a generated Custom Resource Definition (CRD) named ClusterReport, but it is much easier to view the list using a sveltosctl CLI command, as shown in the following example:

```
./bin/sveltosctl show dryrun

### Configuration Drift

_Configuration drift_ is a common term to describe a change that takes place in an environment. Drift is an issue because it causes systems and parts of a system that are supposed to be consistent, to become inconsistent and unpredictable.

In our case, _configuration drift_ is a change of a resource deployed by Sveltos in one of the managed clusters.

When sync mode is set to *SyncModeContinuousWithDriftDetection* for a ClusterProfile, sveltos monitors the state of managed clusters and when it detects a configuration drift for one of the resource deployed because of that ClusterProfile, it re-syncs the cluster state back to the state described in the management cluster.

In order to achieve so, when in this mode:

- sveltos deploys a service in each managed cluster and configures this service with list of kubernetes resources deployed because of each ClusterProfile in SyncModeContinuousWithDriftDetection mode;
- service starts a watcher for each GroupVersionKind with at least one resource to watch;
- when one of the resources being watched is modified (labels, annotations, spec or rules sections), service notifies management cluster about a potential configuration drift;
- management cluster reacts by redeploying afftected ClusterProfiles.

## Managing labels

The core idea of Sveltos is to give users the ability to programmatically decide which addons should be deployed where by utilizing a ClusterSelector that selects all clusters with labels matching the selector. However, users were still required to manage the cluster labels manually.

Sometimes it is preferable for cluster labels to change automatically as the cluster runtime state changed so that:

1. as cluster runtime state changes, cluster labels change;
2. when cluster labels change, ClusterProfile instances matched by a cluster change;
3. because cluster starts matching new ClusterProfile, new set of add-ons are deployed.

For instance, the versions of addons required and/or what addons are needed, depend on the cluster runtime state. Each time a cluster is upgraded, addon versions need to change as well.

To address this scenarion, Sveltos introduced Classifier. It is used to dynamically classify a cluster depending on its runtime configuration. Current classification criteria are either based on the Cluster Kubernetes version or the resource deployed in the cluster.

Classifier also enables you to specify the set of labels that must be added to a cluster for its runtime state to match the Classifier instance.

![Classifier in action](assets/classifier.gif)

Some examples can be found [here](https://github.com/projectsveltos/classifier/tree/main/examples)

```
# Following Classifier will match any Cluster whose
# Kubernetes version is >= v1.24.0 and < v1.25.0
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Classifier
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-v1.24
spec:
  classifierLabels:
  - key: k8s-version
    value: v1.24
  kubernetesVersionConstraints:
  - comparison: GreaterThanOrEqualTo
    version: 1.24.0
  - comparison: LessThan
    version: 1.25.0
```

### Classifier Labels
The field *classifierLabels* contains all the labels (key/value pair) which will be added automatically to any cluster matching a Classifier instance.

### Kubernetes version constraints
The field *kubernetesVersionConstraints* can be used to classify a cluster based on its current Kubernetes version.

### Resource constraints
The field *deployedResourceConstraints* can be used to classify a cluster based on current deployed resources. Resources are identified by Group/Version/Kind and can be filtered based on their namespace and labels and some fields.

## Snapshot

[Sveltosctl](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltosctl) when running as a Pod in the management cluster, can be configured to collect configuration snapshots.
*Snapshot* CRD is used for that.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: utils.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: Snapshot
metadata:
  name: hourly
spec:
  schedule: "0 * * * *"
  storage: /snapshot
```

*schedule* field specifies when a snapshot needs to be collected. It is [Cron format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

*storage* field represents a directory where snapshots will be stored. It must be an existing directory (on a PersistentVolume mounted by sveltosctl)

## Controller configurations

### Sveltos manager

Following arguments can be used to customize sveltos manager controller:

1. *concurrent-reconciles*: by default sveltos manager reconcilers runs with a parallelism set to 10. This arg can be used to change level of parallelism;
2. *worker-number*: number of workers performing long running task. By default this is set to 20. Increase it number of managed clusters is above 100. Read this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@gianluca.mardente/how-to-handle-long-running-tasks-in-kubernetes-reconciliation-loop-3cc04bfa2681) to know more about how Sveltos handles long running task.Â 

## Classifier

1. *concurrent-reconciles*: by default sveltos manager reconcilers runs with a parallelism set to 10. This arg can be used to change level of parallelism;
2. *worker-number*: number of workers performing long running task. By default this is set to 20. If number of Classifier instances is in the hundreds, please consider increasing this;
3. *report-mode*: by default Classifier controller running in the management cluster periodically collects ClassifierReport instances from each managed cluster. Setting report-mode to "1" will change this and have each Classifier Agent send back ClassifierReport to management cluster. When setting report-mode to 1, *control-plane-endpoint* must be set as well. When in this mode, Sveltos automatically creates a ServiceAccount in the management cluster for Classifier Agent. Only permissions granted for this ServiceAccount are update of ClassifierReports.
4. *control-plane-endpoint*: the management cluster controlplane endpoint. Format <ip\>:<port\>. This must be reachable frm each managed cluster.
