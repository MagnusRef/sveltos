Today, it's very common for organizations to run and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across different cloud providers or infrastructures. With an increasing number of clusters, consistently managing Kubernetes add-ons is not an easy task.

[Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos "Manage Kubernetes add-ons") is a lightweight application designed to manage hundreds of clusters. It does so by providing declarative cluster APIs to deploy Kubernetes add-ons across set of clusters. All while also providing platform admin with a solution for multi-tenancy.

Sveltos focuses not only on the ability to scale the number of clusters it can manage, but also to give visibility to exactly which add-ons are installed on each cluster.

## Features List
1. Kubernetes [addon distribution](addons.md) across multiple clusters;
2. [event driven framework](addon_event_deployment.md) to deploy add-ons as response to events in managed clusters. Event can be defined in the form of Lua script. Add-ons can be expressed as template and instantiated using information from resources in the managed clusters;
3. [configuration drift detection](configuration_drift.md): when Sveltos detects a configuration drift, it re-syncs the cluster state back to the state described in the management cluster;
4. [Notification](notifications.md): Sveltos can be configured to send notifications when for instance all add-ons are deployed in a cluster. Custom health checks can be passed to Sveltos in the form of [Lua script](notifications.md#healthcheck-crd);
5. [Templates](template.md) instantiated reading values from management cluster;
6. [Multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy.md) allowing platform admin to easily grant permissions to tenant admins and have Sveltos enforces those;
7. [Dry run](configuration.md#dryrun-mode) to preview effect of a change; 
8. Kubernetes [cluster classification](labels_management.md) and automatic label management based on cluster runtime states;
9. [Techsupport](techsupport.md): collect tech support from managed clusters;
10. [Snapshot and Rollback](snapshot.md).

## Core Concepts

Sveltos is a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) and controllers to deploy kubernetes add-ons across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

1. [ClusterProfile CRD](configuration.md#deploying-add-ons) is the CRD used to instruct Sveltos on which add-ons to deploy on a set of clusters;
2. [Sveltos manager](configuration.md#sveltos-manager) is a controller running in the management cluster. It watches for *ClusterProfile* instances and *cluster* instances (both CAPI Cluster and SveltosCluster). It orchestrates Kubernetes addon deployments: when a cluster is a match for a ClusterProfile instance, all add-ons listed in the ClusterProfile instance are deployed in the cluster.
3. [Classifier CRD](configuration.md#managing-labels) is the CRD used to instructs Sveltos on how to classify a cluster;
4. [Classifier](configuration.md#classifier) is a controller running in the management cluster. Its counterpart, *Classifier Agent* is a controller running in each managed cluster. Classifier distributes Classifier CRD instances to any managed cluster. Classifier Agent watches for cluster runtime state (kubernetes version and/or resources deployed) and Classifier CRD instances. It reports back to management cluster whether a managed cluster is a match or not for each Classifier instance;
5. [RoleRequest CRD](multi-tenancy.md#rolerequest-crd) is the CRD used to allow platform admin to grant permissions to tenant admins;
6. [Sveltosctl](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltosctl "Sveltos CLI") is the Sveltos CLI; 
7. [Techsupport CRD](techsupport.md#techsupport-crd) is the CRD used to instruct Sveltos to collect tech support, both logs and resources, from managed clusetrs;
8. [Snapshot CRD](configuration.md#snapshot) is the CRD used to instruct Sveltos on collecting configuration snapshots;
9. [SveltosCluster](register-cluster.md#register-cluster) is the CRD used to register a cluster with Sveltos (only non CAPI powered cluster needs to be manually registered with Sveltos);
10. [Drift detection manager](configuration.md#configuration-drift) is a controller running in each managed cluster. It watches for Kubernetes resources deployed by ClusterProfiles set in SyncModeContinuousWithDriftDetection mode. Anytime it detects a possible configuration drift, it informs management cluster so that a re-sync happens and the cluster state is brought back to the desidered state expressed in the management cluster;
11. [ClusterHealthCheck](notifications.md#clusterhealthcheck) is the CRD used to configure Sveltos to send notifications when certain conditions happen.
