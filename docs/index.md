<h1>Sveltos Kubernetes Add-on Controller - Simplify Add-on Management in Kubernetes</h1>

[Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos "Manage Kubernetes add-ons") is a Kubernetes add-on controller that makes it easy to deploy and manage add-ons across multiple clusters. It supports a variety of add-on formats, including Helm charts, raw YAMLs, Kustomize, Carvel ytt, and Jsonnet.

Sveltos uses templates to represent add-ons, which can then be instantiated on each cluster during deployment. This allows you to use the same add-on configuration across all of your clusters, while still allowing for some variation, such as different add-on configuration values.

Sveltos can get the information it needs to instantiate the templates from either the management cluster or the managed clusters themselves. This flexibility makes Sveltos a powerful tool for managing add-ons in a variety of environments.

But that's not all! Sveltos not only helps you scale the number of clusters you can manage, but it also provides visibility into exactly which add-ons are installed on each cluster. So you can stay on top of your cluster management game and never miss a beat.

## Add-on Distribution

* Deploy [add-ons](addons.md) across multiple clusters
* Support for Helm charts, Kustomize, YAML, [Carvel ytt](ytt_extension.md) and [Jsonnet](jsonnet_extension.md)
* [Deploy Kubernetes Resources in a Controlled and Orderly Manner](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/manifest_order/)
* Configurable deployment strategies
* Automatic rollbacks

## Templates

* Create [templates](template.md) to express add-ons
* Use templates to instantiate add-ons from management cluster values

## Addon Compliances

* Define custom [add-on compliances](addon_compliance.md)
* Enforce compliances when deploying add-ons

## Event Driven Framework

* Deploy add-ons in response to [events](addon_event_deployment.md)
* Define events in Lua scripts
* Configure framework for [cross-cluster configuration](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/addon_event_deployment/#cross-clusters)

## Other Features

* [Centralised Resource Display for Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](show_resources.md)
* [Configuration drift detection](configuration_drift.md)
* [Dry run](dryrun.md)
* [Notifications](notifications.md)
* Kubernetes [cluster classification](labels_management.md)
* [Multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy.md)
* [Techsupport](techsupport.md)
* [Snapshot and rollback](snapshot.md)

## Core Concepts

Sveltos is a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) and controllers to deploy kubernetes add-ons across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

1. [ClusterProfile CRD](addons.md#deep-dive-clusterprofile-crd) is the CRD used to instruct Sveltos on which add-ons to deploy on a set of clusters;
2. [Sveltos manager](addons.md#sveltos-manager-controller-configuration) is a controller running in the management cluster. It watches for *ClusterProfile* instances and *cluster* instances (both CAPI Cluster and SveltosCluster). It orchestrates Kubernetes addon deployments: when a cluster is a match for a ClusterProfile instance, all add-ons listed in the ClusterProfile instance are deployed in the cluster;
3. [Classifier CRD](labels_management.md#deep-dive-classifier-crd) is the CRD used to instructs Sveltos on how to classify a cluster;
4. [Classifier](labels_management.md#classifier-controller-configuration) is a controller running in the management cluster. Its counterpart, *Classifier Agent* is a controller running in each managed cluster. Classifier distributes Classifier CRD instances to any managed cluster. Classifier Agent watches for cluster runtime state (kubernetes version and/or resources deployed) and Classifier CRD instances. It reports back to management cluster whether a managed cluster is a match or not for each Classifier instance;
5. [RoleRequest CRD](multi-tenancy.md#rolerequest-crd) is the CRD used to allow platform admin to grant permissions to tenant admins;
6. [Sveltosctl](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltosctl "Sveltos CLI") is the Sveltos CLI; 
7. [Techsupport CRD](techsupport.md#techsupport-crd) is the CRD used to instruct Sveltos to collect tech support, both logs and resources, from managed clusetrs;
8. [Snapshot CRD](snapshot.md#snapshot-crd) is the CRD used to instruct Sveltos on collecting configuration snapshots;
9.  [SveltosCluster](register-cluster.md#register-cluster) is the CRD used to register a cluster with Sveltos (only non CAPI powered cluster needs to be manually registered with Sveltos);
10. [Drift detection manager](configuration_drift.md#configuration-drift) is a controller running in each managed cluster. It watches for Kubernetes resources deployed by ClusterProfiles set in SyncModeContinuousWithDriftDetection mode. Anytime it detects a possible configuration drift, it informs management cluster so that a re-sync happens and the cluster state is brought back to the desidered state expressed in the management cluster;
11. [ClusterHealthCheck](notifications.md#clusterhealthcheck) is the CRD used to configure Sveltos to send notifications when certain conditions happen.
